Helm
====

A new conceptual browser.<br />
Based on the concept of Sebastiaan De With : http://dewith.com/2013/helm-a-browser-concept/

# What is this?

This is a simple browser written in C++.

# Basic usage

After compiling Helm, run it.

To create a new Tab, use Cmd+T.
To switch between Tab, press Alt and use Left or Right to change it.
To remove a Tab, press Alt and then Down or use Cmd+W

- The popup address and the sharing view when you drag a text or an image inside a webpage are currently in development.

# Compiling

- Helm 

You must install Qt 5.0.+ to compile the project.

For now, Helm is only usable on Mac OSX, open the .pro in project/mac/

Compile.

# Running

Helm is only compatible with OSX for now but it will be as soon as I can on Windows and Linux.
